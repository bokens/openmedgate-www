Healthcare shouldn't be locked behind proprietary walls.

**OpenMedGate** is a movement for open healthcare infrastructure — enabling interoperability, data autonomy, and innovation without vendor lock-in.

We believe:
- **Doctors deserve freedom** to choose their tools
- **Hospitals deserve control** over their data
- **Patients deserve better care** through open innovation

Join us in building the future of healthcare.

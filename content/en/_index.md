## We connect systems. We unlock data. We eliminate vendor lock-in.

Healthcare should not be locked in technological silos. OpenMedGate is an open integration layer that connects medical systems and enables secure data exchange based on international interoperability standards.

## We believe that:

- **Patient data is subject to the patient’s rights.**  
  The hospital is its administrator. The system vendor is meant to serve, not block access.

- **The hospital chooses the best tools for the patient.**  
  Not the vendor. Not outdated contracts. The decision belongs to the medical institution.

- **Open standards win.**  
  FHIR, HL7, and DICOM have existed for years; it’s time to use their full potential.

- **Together we build more than alone.**  
  Open source is not an ideology. It is the fastest path to interoperable, secure, and innovative healthcare.
